  "transcript": "this is a day i've been looking forward to for two and a half years every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything and apple has been well first of all one's very fortunate if you get to work on just one of these in your career apple's been very fortunate it's been able to introduce a few of these into the world 1984 we introduced the macintosh it didn't just change apple it changed the whole computer industry in 2001 we introduced the first ipod and it didn't just it didn't just change the way we all listen to music it changed the entire music industry well today we're introducing three revolutionary products of this class the first one is a widescreen ipod with touch controls the second is a revolutionary mobile phone and the third is a breakthrough internet communications device so three things a widescreen ipod with touch controls a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough internet communications device an ipod a phone and an internet communicator an ipod a phone are you getting it these are not three separate devices this is one device and we are calling it iphone today today apple is going to reinvent the phone and here it is no actually here it is but we're going to leave it there for now so before we get into it let me uh let me talk about a category of things the most advanced phones are called smartphones so they say and uh they typically combine a phone plus some email capability plus they say it's the internet sort of the baby internet into one device and they all have these plastic little keyboards on them uh and the problem is that they're not so smart and they're not so easy to use so if you kind of make a you know business school 101 graph with a smart access and the easy to use access phones regular cell phones are kind of right there they're not so smart and they're you know not so easy to use but smartphones are definitely a little smarter but they actually are harder to use they're really complicated just for the basic stuff people have a hard time figuring out how to use them well we don't want to do either one of these things what we want to do is make a leapfrog product that is way smarter than any mobile device has ever been and super easy to use this is what iphone is okay so we're going to reinvent the phone now we're going to start with a revolutionary user interface is the result of years of research and development and of course it's an interplay of hardware and software now why do we need a revolutionary user interface i mean here's four smartphones right motorola q the blackberry palm treo nokia e62 the usual suspects and what's wrong with their user interfaces well the problem with them is really sort of in the bottom 40 there it's it's this stuff right here they all have these keyboards that are there whether you need them or not to be there and they all have these control buttons that are fixed in plastic and are the same for every application well every application wants a slightly different user interface a slightly optimized set of buttons just for it and what happens if you think of a great idea six months from now you can't run around and add a button to these things they're already shipped so what do you do it doesn't work because the buttons and the controls can't change they can't change for each application and they can't change down the road if you think of another great idea you want to add to this product well how do you solve this it turns out we have solved it we solved it in computers 20 years ago we solved it with a bitmap screen that could display anything we want put any user interface up and a pointing device we solved it with the mouse right we solved this problem so how are we going to take this to a mobile device well what we're going to do is get rid of all these buttons and just make a giant screen a giant screen now how are we going to communicate this we don't want to carry around a mouse right so what are we going to do oh a stylist right we're going to use a stylus no now who wants a stylist you have to get them and put them away and you lose them yuck nobody wants a stylus so let's not use a stylus we're going to use the best pointing device in the world we're going to use a pointing device that we're all born with we're born with ten of them we're gonna use our fingers we're gonna touch this with our fingers and we have invented a new technology called multi-touch which is phenomenal it works like magic you don't need a stylus it's far more accurate than any touch display that's ever been shipped it ignores unintended touches it's super smart you can do multi-finger gestures on it and boy have we patented it so so we've been very lucky to have brought a few revolutionary user interfaces to the market in our time first was the mouse the second was the click wheel and now we're going to bring multi-touch to the market and each of these revolutionary user interfaces has made possible a revolutionary product the mac the ipod and now the iphone so a revolutionary user interface we're going to build on top of that with software now software on mobile phones is like it's like baby software it's not so powerful and today we're going to show you a software breakthrough software that's at least five years ahead of what's on any other phone now how do we do this well we start with a strong foundation iphone runs os 10. now why why would we want to run such a sophisticated operating system on a mobile device well because it's got everything we need it's got multitasking it's got the best networking it already knows how to power manage we've been doing this on mobile computers for years it's got awesome security and the right apps it's got everything from coco and the graphics and it's got core animation built in and it's got the audio and video that os 10 is famous for it's got all the stuff we want and it's built right in to iphone and that has let us create desktop class applications and networking right not the crippled stuff that you find on most phones this is real desktop class applications now you know one of the pioneers of our industry allen k has had a lot of great quotes throughout the years and i ran across one of them recently that explains how we look at this explains why we go about doing things the way we do because we love software and here's the quote people who are really serious about software should make their own hardware you know alan said this 30 years ago and this is how we feel about it and so we're bringing breakthrough software to a mobile device for the first time it's five years ahead of anything on any other phone"
