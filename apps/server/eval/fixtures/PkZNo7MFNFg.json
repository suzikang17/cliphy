  "transcript": "Beau: This is the Beginner’s Javascript course you are looking for. My name is Beau Carnes. And I’m with freeCodeCamp.org. In this full Javascript course you will learn everything you need to know to get started with Javascript. This course is perfect for beginners or anyone that just wants a refresher on basic Javascript syntax. This course actually goes along with the freeCodeCamp.org Javascript curriculum. So, if you want some live coding challenges to go along with every part of this course, you can check the link in the description to that curriculum. But this is a completely standalone video. So, you don’t need to go through freeCodeCamp.org, but it could be helpful. Also, after this course, you’re going to want to complete some, or build some Javascript projects. So, I have a link in the description to some project tutorials. But then after that, you’re going to want to create some projects on your own. That’s how you really learn Javascript. You have to create things without going through a tutorial and just use a search engine to find the things that you don’t know or need to learn. To go along with the freeCodeCamp curriculum, I have all the ES6 stuff in the second part of this course. That’s pretty much it. Let’s learn some Javascript. So, how exactly do you install Javascript? Well, for the most part, you don’t. Actually, all web browsers can run Javascript. Which is great because a lot of devices have web browsers on them. So, when you write something with Javascript, it will run on all sorts of devices and operating systems. So, you have a few options for writing Javascript. Let me show you a few things you can do to follow along with this course. You could download a code editor. Here, I have Sublime Text. You can also use Visual Studio Code or Atom or any code editor. And I’ve created an HTML file because HTML files can be opened in web browsers. And I have these <script> tags – these are HTML tags. But within our <script> tags, we have our Javascript. So, if I open up this file in a web browser, it looks like this. Well, I can open up my Javascript console. And in the console, you can see it says “hello world.” That’s right from my Javascript program. So, whenever you do console.log, it’s going to show on the console here. You can also just use the code editor that’s included on freeCodeCamp.org. Like I mentioned, this course follows along with the Javascript curriculum on freeCodeCamp.org. And there’s a built-in Javascript editor right in here. And then it shows you the console down here. Another option would be to use CodePen. If you go to CodePen.io, going to go to Create Pen. And then there’s going to be three windows. HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Well, we just care about the Javascript. And in this course, we're not going to be doing anything with HTML and CSS. We just need the Javascript and the Javascript console. So, if I do console.log and then do (“Hello World”) then we can see right in the console \"Hello world.” The final thing you can do would be use Scrimba. Most of the course I actually recorded using Scrimba.com. So, if you want, you can use Scrimba.com to follow along. Once you log in, just click the button. I’m going to and then . And it’s going to open up a new Javascript window. Now, I can increase the font size here. And it already has console.log “Hello from Javascript.” And you can see in the console right here “Hello from Javascript.” Also, if you hit , it reloads everything. And you'll see this popup “Hello from Javascript.” So, that’s something interesting about Scrimba is that has two ways of logging in the console. We have the popup and then we have the console here. You’ll see that in this course too, the two different ways of logging to the console. The first thing we'll talk about in Javascript is comments. Comments are lines of code that Javascript will intentionally ignore. They don’t do anything. They’re just used to create notes for yourself and others about what the code does. So, if you do a // you can make an in-line comment. An in-line comment means it’s at the end of a line of code. For instance, I can put var number = 5. That’s a way to declare a variable. And we'll talk more about that later. But right now we're just talking about comments. You can see that this code is in color because the code editor knows that that’s code that’s going to run. And the comment is automatically grayed out because it’s not going to run. We can also do an in-line comment or I mean a multi-line comment. If we do a /* and I can put \"this is a,” and then I can put \"multi-line comment.” And I'm going to end with a */. So, it begins with a /* and ends with a */. And you can put as much text as you want in between these. And you can see this is all grayed out because it’s all a comment. And then afterwards I can put number = 9 and you can see it will be in color again because it’s no longer commented out. Now we're going to talk about data types and variables. In computer science, data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. And Javascript provides seven different data types that you can use within Javascript. Now, some of the more obvious and most common are strings and numbers. A string is just any sort of text. A number is a number. Now let’s go from the top. So, undefined is something that hasn’t been defined. You may have a variable that you haven’t set to be anything yet. Null means nothing. So, you’ve set this to be something and that thing is nothing. So, you can say this is null or nothing. A boolean means true or false. We talked about string. A symbol is an immutable primitive value that is unique. Now we'll tall more about those later. A number is a number. And an object can store a lot of different key value pairs. Again, we'll talk more about those later. Now, you are often going to set data into a variable. A variable allows computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. It’s basically a label to point to the data. A variable is almost like a box. And you can fill it with anything. You’ll fill it with the data that you want. So, to declare a variable, one way is to use the var keyword. Var stands for variable. And I can say myName. I can set this to anything. It can be any of the datatypes above. But it’s common to set something to a string. So, I can set my name to be “Beau.” Now later, you can set it to be something else. I can say myName = 8. And you can just set it to other data types later. Now, there are actually three ways to declare a variable in Javascript. So, var is one of them. And for a while, that was the only way. But there are other ways too. There’s a way called \"Let.” So, I can say let ourName = “freeCodeCamp”. And then the other thing would be const. So, I can do const Pi = 3,1004. Now, the difference between var, let, and const, a var is going to be able to be used throughout your whole program. Let will only be used within the scope of where you declared that. Now, we're going to be talking about let and const more later. So, I’m just giving you a brief overview of what they are now. Const is a variable that should never change. It can never change. So, like right up here, I declared myName, but then we changed it here. So, it started out to be Beau and we changed it to 8. Const, you can never change it. If you do try to change it, you’ll get an ERROR. Okay, that’s all for now. But like I said. We'll be talking more about the different types of variables later. There’s a difference between declaring variables and assigning variables. Here’s how you assign a variable. var a and then a semicolon. I didn’t mention this earlier, but you end all lines in Javascript with a semicolon. Well, it’s not actually required. You can actually just skip the semicolons completely, but most people recommend that you put a semicolon just so it’s obvious where the end of the line is. So, here, we are just declaring a variable to be called a. And then here, we are assigning a variable. We’re declaring and assigning in one line. So, we're declaring it “var b” And then the equals sign is the assignment operator. It means that 2 is being assigned to b. We're not checking if b = 2. We're just assigning 2 to be. So, after that, we can actually assign other things. So, I can say a = 7. So, now I’ve just assigned 7 to a. I didn’t have to declare a because it was already declared. And I can also say that b = a. So, I’ve now assigned the contents of a to b. And I’ll put the semicolon there. One thing I want to tell you about is console.log. Console.log allows you to see things in the console. So, I’m going to console.log(a). And if I load this here, you can see down here in the console it shows 7. So, right now we've assigned a to be 7. And so, when we console.log(a) it shows 7 down there. If we put another console.log right here, this will allow us to show what a was up here and then down there. So, console.log. Now, if I run that, we can see at first, a was null. And then now it’s 7. So, here is null. And then it’s 7 down here. So, you can check what variables are at various points in your program. Now I’ll show you another example of initializing a variable to an initial value at the same time it’s declared. So, I’m going to say var a = 9. So, the var a is declaring it. And the = 9 is initializing it with the assignment operator, which is the = sign. Before we do anything to these variables, they are uninitialized. That means their value is undefined. We have not set them to anything. But it’s simple to fix that. I’ll just set this to five. I’ll set b to 10 and then we can set c to a string. That’s going to be “I am a string”. And we always have to put it in quotation marks like that. So, you can see a + 1 is going to equal 6. 5 + 1 = 6. b = b + 5. That’s going to be 15. And then c is now going to say \"I am a string”. Variable names and function names in Javascript are case sensitive. That means that capitalization matters. So, this declaration here is not the same as this assignment. Even though letters are the same, the capitalization is not the same. So, it’s not going to assign correctly. And in here, you’ll see there’s an ERROR if we try to run it because this has not been defined. It has not been declared. It’s generally common practice to use camelCase. So, let me show you how we do that instead of StUdLyCapVar, it’s going to be studlyCapVar. So, the first letter is always going to be lowercase. Any time you have a new word or a new section of a word, you just capitalize the first letter. And so, we can change this. This one is correct. So, now we just go down here. studlyCapVar. And then we just do properCamelCase. And then titleCaseOver. So, now all of these should be defined. So, we declare them here. We assign them right here. And then this is not going to give us any errors. It’s going to behave exactly how we want it to behave. Adding two numbers in Javascript is pretty straight forward. You just use the plus operator. So, this says 10 + 0 which equals 10. We can also do, 10 + 10 which is going to equal 20, if we do a console.log, and I can put sum here. And then you’ll be able to see that the answer is 20 right in the console. 10 + 10 is 20. And subtraction is also what you would expect. We have the subtraction sign here. This says 45 – 0. We can also do 45 – 33. And then that would equal 12. So, the difference variable equals 12 now. Multiplication in Javascript uses this * or a star symbol here. So, this says 8 * 0 which is 0. Or we can change it to 8 * 10 which is 80. So now the product variable equals 80. You can divide in Javascript with this / symbol. So, this says 66/0. We can change this to 33. So, now 66/33 is 2. Quotient equals 2. To increment a number means to add 1 to it. So, here we’re incrementing myVar by 1. So, it starts at 87. 87 + 1 is 88. There is a quicker way to increment a number. Instead of doing this, we can just myVar++. myVar++. And now we have incremented myVar from 87 to 88. We learned about incrementing a number with ++. You can also decrement a number with --. That means subtracting one. So, right now, myVar is going to equal 10. 11-1 = 10. We can do the same thing with the -- operator. So, now, myVar still equals 10. We can also create decimal numbers with Javascript. These are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats. You can see this is one here – 5,700. It can be anything. I’m going to make one called myDecimal. And then I’m going to store a 0,00009. Anything that has a decimal point in it, is a decimal point number. Multiplying decimal point or floating point numbers is the same as multiplying integers. So, we have 2,000 times 0,000. If I just change this to 2,500, now the answer to product is going to be 5. And I can console.log that so you can see. If I just put (product). And then if we do the browser here, you’ll see that the answer is five. You can also divide decimal point numbers. So, in this case I’m going to change this to 4,400. So, now the answer to quotient is 2,200. Quotient equals 2,200. The remainder operator looks like a %. And it gives the remainder of the division of two numbers. So, for instance, if I want to find out the remainder of 11 divided by 3, I can do remainder = 11. And then I’m going to put the percent sign %, which is the remainder operator, 3. And 11 divided by 3 is 9. 11-9 is 2. So, the remainder is going to be 2. 11 remainder 3 is 2. The remainder operator is often used to determine if a number is even or odd. If you can divide a number by 2 and the remainder is 0, that means the number is even. It’s common to want to add a number to a variable like this. See, A = A + 12. Well, A starts at 3, plus 12 is 15. So, we're just adding 12 to whatever A is. Here we're adding 9 to whatever B is. Here, we’re adding 7 to whatever C is. This is such a common pattern that there’s a shortcut to do the same thing. It’s the += operator. So, instead of A = A + 12, we can do A += 12. So, this equals the same thing. So, instead of B = 9 + B. We can do B += 9. So, now we're adding the value to the variable and assigning the answer to that variable. So, again here, we can do += 7. So, that’s just a shortcut. Previously, we learned about +=. Well, -= does the same thing, but subtracting. So, this says A = A - 6. We started at 11, minus 6 is going to be 5. So, the new A is going to be 5. But we can shorten that. Instead of A = A - 6, we can do -=. This is just a shortcut that Javascript has that means the same thing. That means A = A - 6. But it’s shortened. Same here. So, we can do -= 15. C = C - 1. We can do C -= 1. So, it just subtracts the number from the original value and then assigns that new value to the variable. [Compound Assignment with Augmented Multiplication] Here we have A = A * 5. Well, we can do the same thing as before. We can shorten this to A *= 5. So, that means the same thing. Here, we can do A *= 3. And then C = C * 10. We can shorten this to C *= 10. And that’s another shortcut for Javascript. And there’s also a /=. So, A = A / 12. We can do A /=12. And here, we can just do /=4. Or /= 11. So, another way of just dividing the variable by a new number and assigning that answer to the variable. We’ve already mentioned strings a little bit. But anytime you have some characters surrounded by quotation marks, they can either be single quotation marks, double quotation marks, or backticks. It’s a string. These are called \"String literals.” And you can create them just like you see above. I’m going to do a few more. So, var myFirstName = “Beau”. And var myLastName = “Carnes”. So, that’s how you create a string in Javascript. Sometimes your string contains the quote symbol. Now, normally the quotes identify the beginning and the ending of the string. But what if you assign like this? “I am a ‘double quoted’ string inside ‘double quotes.’” I’m actually trying to use these quotes right inside the string, but the Javascript doesn’t know what to do about it. It thinks that this is the whole string. When it sees the first quote inside the string, it thinks we're at the end of the string. So, there’s something called an escape character. So, if you want to escape a quote, that means it will no longer be considered the end of the string. I’m going to put a \\. So, if I put a \\ before each of these quotation marks, Javascript no longer interprets as being the last character in the string. So, now you can see this is a full string. And then if I log this count console.log and I put (myStr), you’ll see that it’s not going to show the quotation marks. So, I mean it’s not going to show the / and the \\. It shows the quotation marks without the \\ because when we put \\” Javascript knows that this should just mean a quotation mark. We talked about escaping a quote character like this, where you put a \\ before the quote character so Javascript knows that this is supposed to be a literal quote character inside the string. However, you’re not going to have to escape quote characters very often because there are other methods of accomplishing the same thing of having a quote character within a string. So, a common way is to use – instead of having your string start with double quotes, have it start with a single quote. So, a string can either be surrounded by ‘single quotes’ or “double quotes”. So, this time we're just going to have ‘single quotes’. And now I can remove all of these escape characters from inside the string here. Okay, so now you can see that Javascript still knows that this is a string, even though it has these double quotes inside. An additional thing you can do is use backticks. So, if I put backticks before – at the beginning and the end of the string, now I actually can use single quotes and double quotes both within the string. But right now, I’m just going to focus on showing you the double quotes or the single quotes with the “double quotes” inside. We talked about escaping a double quote character by using the \\ before the double quote. There’s actually quite a few other things you can escape out. You can escape out a single quote character. You can escape out a backslash. In fact, anytime you’re going to use a \\, you’re going to have to put two backslashes so the Javascript knows that you’re not trying to escape a character. You can also add a new line character, or a carriage return, a tab, a backspace, or a form feed, all with doing a slash and the corresponding letter here. So, let me show you an example. I’m going to put a var myString = and we're going to make a multiline string. So, we're going to have the “FirstLine.” And now, I’m going to put \\n to add a second line. And then I’m going to put a tab. So, \\t for the tab. And \\\\ to add a \\. Now, it’s going to say SecondLine. Now, I’ll do a \\ and then I’ll just say ThirdLine. And if I were able to logout all of that, you would see three different lines. And you would see the tab and then the backslash character. You can concatenate strings with the + operator. You can see here that we have two strings. “I come first” and “I come second”. They’ve been added together or concatenated with this. So, the ourStr, our string, is now one long string that says \"I come first. I come second”. I’ll give you another example here. So, we can say, myStr = “This is the start.” And then I’m going to put a space before the end quotation mark because when these get concatenated together we want there to be a space between these two sentences. And I’ll say \"This is the end.” Now let’s just see what that looks like. I’ll do a console.log. And do a (myStr) and let’s see. If I run this, we can see “This is the start. This is the end.” Just one long string. You can also concatenate strings using the += operator. You can see here in this example we have the ourStr = “I come first”. And then we have the ourString += “I come second.” So, remember, just like when you’re using numbers, += means that you take whatever is on the end here and add it to the variable. So, we’ve just added \"I come second.” onto the end of “I come first.” Let’s do another example down here. myStr = “This is the first sentence.” And then I’ll put a space at the end because we're going to do a, myStr – and here I’ll do the += “This is the second sentence.” Now, if I just do a console.log here of (myStr) we should see that those sentences have gone together. “This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence.” Good. You can concatenate strings together with variables. You can see here ourName = “freeCodeCamp”;. “Hello, our name is “ and then we add this variable, the ourName variable which is freeCodeCamp. “Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp. How are you?” Well, we're going to do the same thing down here. So, I’m going to do myName = “Beau”;. And then myStr is going to equal “My name is “ And then I’m going to add the variable name which is my name. And then I’ll continue the string here. That’s supposed to be a + here. “ and I am well!” See that I put a space here and here because you have to make sure you put appropriate spaces in. And let’s see what that looks like. I’ll do a console.log. I’ll just put (myStr) here. If I show that \"My name is Beau and I am well!” Looks good. You can append variables to strings with this += operator. You can see where this variable anAdjective which is set to the word “awesome”. And then we have another variable \"freeCodeCamp is “. And then we have the ourStr variable += anAdjective. So, now our string is going to equal “freeCodeCame is awesome!”. So, let me show you another example. We're going to say someAdjective = “worthwhile”. And now, I’m going to use the +=, so myStr += and then I can put someAdjective. So, now after we do the myStr += someAdjective, myStr is going to say “Learning to code is worthwhile.” Sometimes you want to find the length of a string. Javascript makes this easy. So, we have the firstName is set to “Ada”. But we just use the .length property to find the length. So, firstName.length. Remember, firsName is “Ada” here. And then .length will return an integer, a number that has the number of characters in the string. So, that will be three. So, let’s try this again. Here’s another example. lastNameLength = lastName. We just have to type in .length. And just to show you, let me console.log that and you'll be able to see if I put in (lastNameLength) and if I run that you'll see 8 because there are 8 characters in the word “Lovelace”. Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string. So, you can see right here, we have the firstName = “Ada”. And right here we the have firstName. And then here’s the bracket notation. You can see there’s brackets with a number inside. So, most modern programming languages like Javascript don’t start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0 which is called \"Zero-based Indexing.” So, with the number 0, that refers to first index of the string which would be the A. So, the A would be 0. D = 1. And then A = 2. So, this first letter of firstName, if we do firstName with the bracket notation with a zero, that’s going to = A. So, let me show you another example. Let’s say we want to get the first letter of the last name. Again, I’m just going to do the bracket notation and put a zero here. If I wanted the second letter, the O, I would put a 1 here. So, if I console.log we can see what it came up with. So, console.log. (firstLetterOfLastName). And if we look in the console \"L” because the first letter of the last name is L. Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered once created. This does not mean that they cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. So, look at this example. myStr and then we're going to use bracket notation to choose the first letter. So, it currently says \"Jello World”. We want the first letter to change to an H to say “Hello World”. But if I run that, there’s going to be an error because of the immutability of strings. Now, we can still change this to “Hello World” but we can’t just change an individual letter like that. So, we're going to have to do myStr = and I’m just going to have to type in the whole thing which is “Hello World”. And now, it will change to the word “Hello World.” You can use bracket notation to get any character position in a string. So, earlier we did the first position, but here’s how you get the second position. Remember, the 0 index. So, is the second position. is the first position. We can also get the third letter of the last name using the brackets. We’ll just put in the brackets to get the third letter of the last name. You can also use bracket notation to find the last letter in a string even if you don’t know how many letters are in the string. You do it based on the length. So, if you look really here, in the brackets we have an expression to be evaluated. . So, the length is 3. 3-1 is 2. The reason why we’re doing a -1 is because remember we count starting at 0. So .length-1 is going to be the last index of the name. So, you can do that same thing here to get the last letter of the last name, I can just do lastName. And that’s going to get the last letter of the last name which is the E right here. [Bracket Notation to Find Nth-to-Last Character in String] We saw how to use bracket notation to get the last letter of a string. You can also do the third to last letter or fourth to last letter. So, you just subtract however much you want from the length of the string. So, we have the bracket notation, . That’s going to get the third to last letter. So, we want the second to last letter. Into this variable here we do something similar. We just do . And then we're going to subtract 2 to get the second to last character of the string. We’re going to use our knowledge of strings to build a Mad Libs style word game. In a Mad Lib game you are provided sentences with some missing words like nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. And then you fill in the missing pieces with words of your choice to make a sentence that could be funny and hopefully makes a little bit of sense. So, let me show you how you do this. This also uses a function. Now, we haven’t talked about functions yet. I’m going to explain those more later. But for now just go with it because that’s not the point of this lesson for now. But this function called wordBlanks, you can call the function and you have to pass in certain types of words. You pass in a noun, an adjective, a verb, and an adverb. So, down here, you can see that we're calling the function called wordBlanks. That’s the function name here. And we're passing in a noun, an adjective, a verb, and an adverb. So, the point is that we are going to use all these words that are passed in to make a sentence. So, we know that var result = an empty string at first. And then we have to use all these words in result. And then the result is going to be returned from this function. And eventually, it’ll be logged out onto this screen with this console.log. So, what I’m going to do here is do result +=. We're going to use the += to add something to this result using all the noun, the adjective, the verb, and the adverb. So, let’s see. It’s going to say “The “ and then we'll use the adjective myAdjective. In this case, the big. The big and then let’s put the noun. myNoun because adjectives are words that describe nouns. The big dog. And then we're going to say what this now is doing – the verb. myVerb. The big dog ran. And then where does he run to? “to the store ”. And then we're going to add – oh, we need a space here. So, there’s a space between “ to the store “. And then we're going to add the final adverb. So, now, we have to add a period. And there’s one more thing we have to add, or a few more things. So, right now myAdjective, myNoun, myVerb. And there’s no spaces in between those. So, if I run that you can see what that’s going to look like in the console. It just said, with no spaces. So, we're going to have to add some spaces in here also. Let’s do that. And now, it’s going to take in the noun, adjective, verb, and adverb and then put it into that sentence. So, one cool thing is we can actually pass in some different words. So, like for instance, if I copy this, I’m going to paste it. Instead of “dog” I will put for the noun “bike”. And an adjective I’ll put “slow”. And then for the verb, I’ll put “flew”. And the adverb I’ll put “slowly”. And now if we look in the console we have two sentences. The big dog ran to the store quickly. The slow bike flew to the store slowly. Arrays allow you to store several pieces of data in one place. So, look at this example, ourArray. Now, arrays always start with a bracket and then end with a bracket to show the beginning and ending of the array. And every element in the array is separated by a comma. So, you can see here the first element is a string. The second element is a number. And you can have more and more elements. You just put comma and you can keep adding elements. And the elements can be any data type. You can see here we have a string and a number, but you can also use arrays or floating numbers or really any sort of data type in your array. So, lets see another example. So, let’s do myArray = . And then for a number we’ll do 1 because Quincy is number 1. When one of the elements in an array is another array, that’s called a nested array or a multidimensional array. You can see here’s the beginning of the array and here’s the end of the array. But the first element in this array is another array with two elements of its own. Same with here. The second element is an array. So, this is two arrays within another array. So, we can do that here. Here’s another example. So, let’s our first element in the array will be an array with a string and a number. And then I’ll put a comma to put the second element of the array which will be another array with a string and a number. Earlier we learned how to use bracket notation to find a specific index in a string. You can do the same thing with arrays. So, look at this array, ourArray. We have three elements. . And these have the indexes . So, with this ourArray with the bracket notation and the , that’s going to be index 1, which is going to equal 50. So, we can do the same thing here. myArray = . So, let’s try to find the first element in that array. So, var myData = myArray. And then I’m going to do index . I can do index , index . And then if we console.log that, we can see for sure what that is. So, if I put (myData) and we can see in the console it’s 50. You can use array indexes to modify arrays. Now, we tried to do this earlier with strings using bracket notation and we were not able to modify a string using bracket notation. But with arrays, you can. So, the original array is . And then we're going to use the array index of . Now, is going to be the second number. Remember, . And this number 64 is going to be set to 45. So, the new array is going to be . Let’s try it again with this, . So, let’s do myArray and then instead of doing the second digit, I’m going to do the first digit in then array, the first index which would be index . And I will say = 45. So, now this array has been updated. So, if I do a console.log and then do (myArray], we'll see that the array is now . You can also use bracket notation to select an element in a multi-dimensional or array of arrays. So, you can see this array here, we have our outer array. But inside that array are more arrays. The elements of the array are other arrays. And the last element of the array actually has an array in this. So, this is a three-layer deep array right here. So, to access an array of arrays or an element within an array that’s within an array, you use a double bracket notation. So, if you see this example here, myArray, the first bracket is . That’s going to get the first element in the array which will be right here. And then that element is an array. So, the second bracket would be the index of the array within the array. So, this zero would point to here. So, let’s try to figure out how we can select a value equal to 8. Well, let’s see. I see an 8 right here. So, let’s figure out what this first number should be. Well, let's count. Zero, one, two. So, the third array would be index . Now, we want to go zero, one – now we have to do index to get the second number in the third array. So, let’s test to see if that equals 8. So, I’ll do a console.log and then do (myData) here. And we'll see if that equals 8. And it does. We did it. You can have pinned data to the end of an array with the push function. So, see, an array has been set up here, ourArray. And then we take ourArray right here and use the push function to push into the next element in the array another array here. So, now it’s going to look like this. We can see at the end of the original array, we’ve pushed this other array at the end. So, let’s try it again down here. We have myArray. And you can see we have each element in the array is another array. So, I am going to do myArray.push(). And then I can push something on the end here which will be like above, another array. So, this is going to say . And now we've pushed this onto the array. We can remove an item from an array with the pop() function here. So, see this pop() here? And then we know it’s a function because of the parenthesis at the end of the word pop. So, the array starts with . which is the 3 and then it’s going to put it right into this variable here. So, now as you can see down here, removedFromOurArray now equals 3. And then ourArray is going to equal because the 3 has been popped off. So, we can do the same thing here. So, removedFromMyArray = myArray.pop() and we can see what the array is going to equal now if I just do a console.log(myArray). And if you do this, we can see that the array only has the one item, the one array instead of the two arrays. The shift function is very similar to the pop function except it removes the first element of the array instead of the final element. So, we see the shift function on the end of the array here. And the array is the same as before. But now the first element “Stimpson” is being removed. After we shift off the first element the array is going to equal “J” \"cat”. And the removedFromOurArray is going to equal “Stimpson”. So, let’s do another example down here. We're going to do a shift() again. So, I’m going to do = myArray.shift(). And now myArray is just going to equal . And the removedFromMyArray is going to equal . The unshift() function is similar to the push() array function. While push() adds an element to the end of the array, unshift() adds at element to the beginning of the array. So, let’s look through this example code. We have the array – . We're going to shift off the first element, remove the first element. So ourArray is . Now, we're going to unshift() or add an element at the beginning which is the string “Happy”. So, the array will now be . So, let’s try again. This time the array is , ]. Because of the shift, we’ve shifted off the . And now I’m going to unshift() something. So, I’ll do myArray.unshift(). Now we're going to add something to the beginning of the array. We’ll do (). So, now the array is just going to be , ]. Let me give you another example of nested arrays. This will be a shopping list. So, inside this array we're going to have another array. And we're going to have items. Cereal – how many boxes? 3 boxes. We also need some milk. Let’s get two cartons of milk. Let’s get some bananas. Three bunches of three bananas. We'll also get some juice. Two containers of juice. And finally, we will get some eggs. We'll get 12 eggs. And now we've created an array of arrays which is our shopping list. Functions allow us to create reusable code in Javascript. This is how a function is set up. We have the word function. Then we have the function name. There’s always parenthesis here. And you can pass information into the parenthesis. We'll talk about that later. And then we have these curly brackets. So, this is the opening curly bracket {. And then we have the closing curly bracket }. And everything inside the curly bracket is run anytime the function is called or invoked. So, here the function is being called by just putting the function name with parenthesis after the name. So, every time this function is called, just like this, the console is going to say \"Heyya, World”. So, if we load the console right now you can see it says \"Heyya, World”. And if I just copy this and paste it a few times we'll see that it’s going to say \"Heyya, World. Heyya, World. Heyya, World” in the console. Since we have run the function three times, we see the words “Heyya, World” three times. So now I’m going to create my own function that’s going to be very similar. So, we'll do function reusable function(). And this time it’s going to say something slightly different. It’s going to say “Hi world” instead of “Heyya, World.” And now I can call the function down here, just like this – reusableFunction. Oh, forgot to put the parenthesis. That’s important. Now you see \"Heyya, World” and “Hi World” in the console. Parameters are variables that act as place holders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. So, we have defined a function right here called ourFunctionWithargs. And inside the parenthesis we see the letters (a, b). Now, these could be any name. We could call these anything, not just (a,b). They can really be any words up here. And that means that when this function is called we're going to pass data into the function. Or input data into the function. So, you can see the example here where we're calling the function. And instead of saying, (a,b) in the parenthesis, we're actually passing the values (10, 5). So, when the function runs, it can use the information that’s passed into the function. So, in this case it says console.log(a-b). Well, that’s going to be 10-5 because the numbers 10 and 5 have been passed into the function. And that’s going to output 5. So, I’m going to create a function that’s very similar to that that function. This one is going to be called functionWithArgs. And it’s also going to accept an (a, b), but we could call it anything we want. And inside instead of subtracting a-b, we're going to do (a+b). Now, I’m just going to call this function functionWithArgs and I’ll pass in (10, 5) and let’s see what that looks like in the console. So, first it outputted 5 for this one. And then it output 10 for this one. Scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have global scope. Global scope means they can be seen everywhere in your Javascript code. For instance, I’m going to declare a variable right here called myGlobal. I’ll set it to 10. Now since this is set outside of a function, we can see it anywhere in the whole code. Even in this function right here called fun2. We can see that we reference it here and here. And we're going to be able to see it. Now, this is an if statement. Which we will talk more about later. But we're checking if the type of myGlobal does not equal “undefined”. So, it will not equal “undefined” if it has been defined and the program knows about the variable. Since this is global scope, it does not equal undefined. It equals 10. The program knows about the variable because this is in global scope. So, since this function can access the myGlobal variable, it will run what’s in this if statement where we just add to this output variable, myGlobal. And then we put the value of myGlobal which is 10. Now, here’s another example where we're going to see if the type of oopsGlobal equal “undefined”. Well, we're going to set that here. So, it is possible to set a variable without using the var keyword. So, I’m going to set this to oopsGlobal = 5. So, you can see here that there is no var keyword. So, normally if you do use a var keyword, since this is within a function, it will be scoped to that function. If we have the var keyword here, this would be scoped to this function so you would not be able to see it in this function. However, since we forgot to put the var keyword in this example, there’s no var keyword, it becomes global automatically. That means you can access it anywhere else in the program including here. So, if we put the var keyword, then oopsGlobal would equal “undefined”. And then we would never have this line in the output. However, since we did not put the var keyword, oopsGlobal = 5 and this will be added to the output – oopsGlobal and then the colon 5. So, when we console.log the output it’s going to say myGlobal 10, oopsGlobal 5. Now actually it’s not going to say that because this is in Scrimba. And in Scrimba it’s more careful and just enforces the fact that you have to use a var keyword. But if we were in our browser it would not enforce the var keyword. And then it would actually show myGlobal 10, oopsGlobal 5. If this was a little complicated, don’t worry about that because a lot of these concepts we’ll be going over again later with additional examples. Variables which are declared within a function as well as the function parameters have local scope. That means they’re only visible from within the function. Let me show you what I mean. If I declare a variable right here, myVar = 5. So, we've declared this variable inside a function. So, this variable, myVar is only visible inside the function. So, it says console.log(myVar). It should console.log the 5. So, we're going to call the function here. And it’s going to console.log myVar. But then the program is going to run this console.log that’s outside of the function. It’s still going to try to access myVar. And so, let’s see what happens. You can see in the console that first there’s a 5 because it console.log within the function, then there’s an error because it tried to access myVar outside of the function. So, really, we just need to delete this where we try to access the variable outside of the function. And now there is no error. It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedent over the global variable. Let me show you an example. Here we have a function called myOutfit that’s going to return outerWear. That’s this variable up here. This is a global variable because it is declared outside of the function. So, when we console.log the output of the myOutfit function, the myOutfit function is going to return outerWear which is the word “T-Shirt”. So, let’s just check the console and you can see, yep \"T-Shirt” is there. However, let’s change this up a bit. So, you have some space here because I’m going to put var outerWear = “sweater”. So, now if I run this program you can see in the console it’s going to say “sweater” instead of “T-Shirt”. It’s because this local variable outerWear took precedence over the global variable. Another interesting thing about this, if I do a console.log. And I console.log the outerWear variable, we'll see that it’s still “T-Shirt.” So, first you see in the console it says sweater and T-Shirt. So, first we console.log this function which is sweater – it returns sweater. And then we console.log the global variable which is T-Shirt. You can return a value from a function with this return statement. So, we have this function here. And we’re passing a number into it – the num. And then it’s going to return whatever is after the return keyword. In this case, num-7. So, here we're going to console.log the function. And it returns the result of -7, is this 10-7, which is 3. So, it’s going to console.log the number 3. If we look in the console, yep, it console.log the number 3 because the function returns 3. Let’s try creating another one. This function is going to be called timesFive. Again, we'll pass in a number. And it’s just going to return something. It’s going to return the num * 5. And then just like before, we can test it using a console.log (timesFive) and we'll pass in the number 5 here. And if I run this, we'll see that it retuns the number 25. [Understanding Undefined Value Returned from a Function] Functions can have return statements, but they don’t have to. In this case, this function adds 3 to the sum variable which is a global variable because it’s defined before the function. It does not return anything. So, if you don’t specify a return value, the return value is just undefined. Now I’m going to create another function that is similar. This is going to be called addFive(). And this time we'll just do sum = sum+5. Or we can shorten this to use the +=. So now that’s going to add five to the sum also, but it’s not going to return anything. So, if we log this out, it would be undefined. It’s simple to assign a returned value to a variable. See right here we have the function change. And you pass in a number and it’s going to return the result of this mathematical expression. So, when we call the function change and pass in the 10, the value that is returned from this function is going to be stored in this variable here. We can do the same thing down here. First we initialize the variable processed and processedArg. It’s going to return the result of this mathematical expression. So, I can set processed to equal what this function returns. So, I can say processedArg. And then I’ll just pass in the number 7 here. And now processed equals the result of this mathematical expression. In computer science a cue is an abstract data structure where items are kept in order. New items can be added to the back of the cue and old items are taken off from the front of the cue. We're going to simulate that right now, some of the functionality of a cue using this nextInLine function. So, the purpose of this is to show that in this nextInLine function you can add an item to the array that’s passed in. And then it’s going to return the first item on the list. For instance, if we have this array right here, if we add an item to this array it should come after at the end. So, it should come after 5. And then it should return the first item on the list. In this case, it’s 1. So, you see, we had some console.log set up. So, it should show what the list looks like, the array looks like beforehand. And then show what it looks like afterwards. This JSON.stringify is just a way to change an array into a string that can easily be printed out to the screen. So, to do this, we're just going to have to do two things that we've learned about already. So, the first thing is to add the item onto the list. So, we see right here, nextInLine passed in the testArr and 6. So, we're calling this function nextInLine. We're passing in this testArr here. And the number 6. We want the number 6 to be added to the end of the array. So, we'll just do arr.push(). And then I’ll put in (num). Just like that. Oh, actually, it’s (item). So, what we did, we took this array that was passed in here which is in this case, testArr. And we push the time that was passed in. And in this case here, it’s item 6. Now we want to return the first item on the list. We want to remove and return this item. So, that we console.log here it should show the number 1. So, instead of returning item, I’m going to return arr.shift(). That’s what shift does. Shift moves the first item and returns that first item. So, let’s check this out. Okay, you can see before, . Then we've popped off the 1 and after it is . We did it. Booleans are another datatype in Javascript. There are only two values, true or false. They’re basically little on/off switches where true is on and false is off. They don’t use quotation marks around the Boolean. See, it just says return false. So, this is a function here. It should be indented, where it’s going to return false when you call this function. It could also be true. So, we could return true. You can use true and false in more places than just function returns and we'll be talking more about that later. An if statement is used to make decisions in code. The keyword If tells Javascript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions defined in the parenthesis. So, here is a full if statement right here. And there’s always parenthesis after the keyword if. And here’s the condition. So, if the stuff inside these parenthesis evaluates to true, then the code within these curly braces will be evaluated or run. So, in this case, it’s a variable. So, if the isItTrue variable is true, it will return “Yes, it’s true”. Now if this is not true, then we'll get to the second return statement \"No, it’s false”. So, this whole function here takes in a variable. And we check if that’s true or not. So, I’m going to make another example just like this. We have another function that hasn’t been filled out yet, trueOrFalse. And there’s a variable that’s passed in (wasThatTrue). So, we'll say if – and then the parenthesis (wasThatTrue). If that’s true, we're going to return something. It will be a string just like before. And the string is \"Yes, that was true”. If it’s not true, then we'll get to the second return statement in the function. And we'll return a different string. We'll return “No, that was false”. I’ll just add some semicolons, and then I can run this. And we'll see what happens. Oh, return needs to be spelled correctly. So, let me spell return correctly. So, before I run this, I’m going to add a console.log. So we can console.log the answer. So, this is the function call here, true or false. We’re passing in true. And then we're going to log what is returned here. “Yes, that was true”. Since we passed in true, this if statement evaluates to true and this code is run right here. There are many comparison operators in Javascript that will return a Boolean of true or false. The most common is the equality operator. And it’s often used in an if statement. So, here it just says if (val). So, we have this whole if statement right here, if (val). We're going to see if if (val) = 12. Now, to check if it equals 12, we're going to have to use the ==. That is the equality operator and we'll say if (val == 12). The reason why we can’t just use a single equal sign is that a single equal sign is the assignment operator. If we just had a single equal sign, that would mean that we were setting the value of the val variable to equal 12. We're not trying to set this to equal 12, we're trying to check if the value of this variable equals 12, so we have to use the double equal sign. So, now, this testEqual function is going to test to see if the number we pass in is equal to 12. I can do a console.log here. Console.log. And then we can see what appears in the console here. “Not Equal” because 10 does not equal 12. We learned about the equality operator which is the double equal == sign. There’s also the strict equality operator, the triple equal sign ===. So, here we're checking if 3 equals 3 with the strict equality operator. So, the difference is that the equality operator, the double equals sign attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type while the strict equality operator does not do the type conversion. So, this is going to evaluate to true, the 3 === 3. But the 3 === ‘3’ with the string on the side is going to evaluate to false. Both of these would be true if we were using the double equals sign == because the string would be converted to a number and it would be equal to true. But with the === it does not get converted to a number, so it would be evaluated to false – this second one with the three equal signs. So-and-so, here, we're just going to use it right in this if statement. And do === 7. So, now we can pass in the number 7 and it’s going to evaluate to true. But if we pass in a string 7, it will evaluate to false. We will do one more review with the equality operator and the strict equality operator. So, if I run this here, we'll see in the console it says \"Equal” because it’s checking if the number 10 and the string “10” are equal. So, if a = b, the number 10 equals a strict number 10, return “Equal”. Since we're using the equality operator with two equal signs, it performs a type conversion. And it converts the string into a number. But if we use the strict equality operator with three equal signs, I’ll run that again, and you’ll see “Not Equal” in the console because now it’s not converting the types and it’s just checking if a number is equal to a string, which it’s not, so we get not equal. Now I will show you the inequality operator which is basically the opposite of the equality operator. So, I’m going to do the inequality operator with an exclamation point and an equal sign. In this case, I’m going to see if the value is not equal to 99. And again, just like the equality operator, this does type conversion. So, let’s just run this program and we'll see it is “Not Equal” because 10 – we passed in 10 into the function here. And 10 is not equal to 99, so we get “Not Equal”. The strict inequality operator is basically the opposite of the strict equality operator. Now, it works like this. So, it says if (val) – I’m going to do if (val) does not equal 17. So, this is the strict inequality operator. Instead of one equal sign we have two equal signs. And that means it’s going to check if this is not true. But it’s not going to convert types. So, for instance, if we were checking if the number 3 does not equal the string 3, that would be true. So, in this example, we're just checking if 10 does not equal 17. If we run this, we will see it’s not equal. We can also use the greater than operator. So, in this function we're checking if a value is over 100. So, I’m going to put greater than 100. And then here we're checking if a value is over 10, so I’ll put greater than 10. So, here we call the function. We pass in 10. And if I run that function, you'll see “10 or Under” because we're not over 100. We’re not over 10. 10 or under, because we passed in 10. [Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator] We can also use the greater than or equal to operator. So, we'll finish this function by using greater than or equal to. It’s just a >=. And we'll put 20 down here. Just greater than or equal to 10. If I run that, we should see “10 or Over” because we're passing in 10 and it’s greater than or equal to 10. Now I’ll show you an example of the less than operator. With this function, we're going to check if the value is less than 25. And then up here we're checking if a value is less than 55. So, here, it’s a trick I use to remember which symbol is less than and which symbol is more than. If you see the less than symbol looks kind of like the letter L which is the first letter in less than. And then the more than symbol is just the opposite. [Comparisons with the Less Than Or Equal To Operator] And we also have the less than or equal to operator we can use in Javascript. So, here, we're going to check if it’s less than or equal to 12. So, we just put the less than operator 12. Equal – less than or equal. That’s an important part. Here it’s the less than or equal to 24 to make this statement true. And if we run, we see “Small Than or Equal to 12”. The number 10 we passed in. Sometimes you want to check if 2 things are true at the same time. For instance, you may want to check if this value is less than or equal to 50. And you also want to check if the value is more than or equal to 25. So, here we have a nested if statement. So, it’s going to check if it’s less than equal to 50 and if it’s more than equal to 25, then it’s going to return “Yes”. But there’s an easier way to do this. So, what I’m going to do is copy this where it says value is more than or equal to 25, I’m going to delete this nested if statement. So, we don’t need that if statement. And I’m going to use the And operator. So, we have less than or equal to 50. And if I put two ampersands, like this, that means and. Now, I’m going to put value is more than or equal to 25. So, this says if value is less than or equal to 50 and the value is also more than or equal 25, then we're going to return “Yes.” So, both this statement and this statement have to be true to get inside this if statement here. In this code here, we’re checking if the value is not between 10 and 20. So, if the value is less than 10, we return “Outside”. And if the value is more than 20, we return “Outside”. There is an easier way to do this with the logical Or operator. So, I’m just going to delete this whole if statement here. And then I can add an or statement. Which is just two pipes. So, I’m going to put val is more than 20 here. So, now, we're checking if the value is less than 10 or if the value is more than 20. Either way, we're going to return “Outside”. And if it’s not true, we'll return “Inside”. When an if statement is true, normally the block of code right after the if statement will be evaluated. And if it’s not true, nothing happens. But with an else statement, an alternate block of code can be executed when it’s not true. So, this is a perfect use case. If value is more than 5, the result is bigger than 5. If the value is less or equal to 5, the result is 5 or smaller. We can do this with an else statement. So, I’m just going to type in else here. And then we can just delete this whole if statement. Just like that. And now we have if the value is less than 5. The result is going to be “Bigger than 5”. Else, if it’s not more than 5, we'll return “5 or Smaller”. If you have multiple conditions that need to be addressed, you can use else if statements. It’s a way of chaining if statements together. In this example, we have three conditions. If value is more than 10, we're going to return greater than 10. If it’s less than 5, return smaller than 5, or else we're going to return 5 and up. So, this is a perfect use case for an else if statement. So, this is how we do it. We’ll do else and then just we're going to add the if statement at the end of the else. I’m just going to delete all of this stuff. So, else if value is less than 5, and then we're going to have one final else statement. Else – and I’m going to put this statement here. This final return. Just going to cut that. And then paste in right in there. So now, instead of using multiple if statements, we have the if and then we have the else if, and then we have the else. When you’re using else if statements order is very important. Let’s look at this example here. In this function, first we check if the value is less than 10 and return less than 10, then else if we check if the value is less than 5, and return less than 5. Well, if we look at this example and we pass in the number 7. If I run this, you’ll see it’s going to say \"Less than 10” which is what we want. However, if we put 3 it’s still just going to say “Less than 10”. Really, we want this to say \"Less than 5” because it is actually less than 5. However, this is in the wrong order. So, what we need to do is change the order. So, this should be 5. This should be 5. And this should be 10. And this should be 10. So, once the first condition is met, it doesn’t even check for the rest of and conditions. So, that’s why it’s important to think about the order. So, if we run this now, yeah \"Less than 5”. That’s what we want. You can also chain if and else if statements. So, I’m going to complete the following challenge here. Write chained if/else if statements to fulfill the following conditions. So, we have these conditions. If the number is less than 5, we're going to return “Tiny”. If it’s less than 10, return “Small”, and so on. So, what I’m going to do is actually just copy this right here because this is written – part of it is written exactly how we want it to be written. I’ll just paste it here. And I’m going to just add the if and else statements. So, it’s going to be if – and then we put this in parenthesis because the condition is always in paranthesis. If number is less than 5, then we're going to use the curly braces and we're going to return “Tiny”. So, I’ll just move that up here. I’ll cut it and paste it. Now, we're going to use an else if statement. And I got the curly braces. First of all, also I need to put the condition in these parenthesis. I’m just going to cut this. Number is less than 10. Put it right here. And we're going to return this “Small”. So, I’ll put that in the curly braces here. And then we have another else if statement. Else if and the condition. Just like before, the number is less than 15. Put that in there. We always need the curly braces to show what’s going to happen in the if statement. So, I’m just cutting and pasting this text again. We have an else if. And then we have this here. And we have return “Large”. Another – actually, the final thing is just going to be else. We don’t even need an else if with this statement at the end. We don’t even need to put the condition because if it’s more than or equal to 20 that’s going to be everything else. So, I’m just going to cut this. We don’t need any of this stuff here. And we're just going to return “Large”. So, with this one test here, for test 7, we can actually console.log that. Console.log. And see what it returns for 7. We can try a few different things. Oh, we have an error here. Oh, forgot to – I put this parenthesis the wrong way. Let’s try that again. “Small” but if this is 20, it should be “Huge”. And if it’s 19, which would be less than 20, we should see “Large”. Yep, that worked. In the game of golf each hole has a par which means the average number of strokes you’re supposed to use to get the ball into the hole. So, depending on how far above or below par your strokes are, there’s a different nickname. So, here are some of the nicknames \"Hole-in-one!” “Eagle” “Birdie” “Par” and we're going to write a function where you pass in the par and you also pass in the strokes. You can see up here, par and strokes. And it’s going to return the nickname. So, that’s what we're going to write. You can see this table here shows what we have to do. If the strokes are 1, then you get “Hole-in-one!”. If the stroke is less than or equal to par-2, you get an “Eagle”. And so on. And we also have this array that’s going to make it easier because we can just use things from this array instead of typing out the words. So, we're going to start with an if statement. If – and then we have to put the condition. If (strokes) == that’s the equality operator. We don’t want to use a single equals sign because that would be the assignment operator. If it equals 1, then we can return. And we can see down here, we're going to return “Hole-in-one!”. But we can just use it from this names array. So, it’s going to be names. And this is going to be index zero of the array. So, we'll do names and then . And then we can do an else if. Else if – and then we can put the condition, (strokes). I have to spell strokes right. Strokes. And then we can just actually copy this right from here. Less than or equal to par-2. And then we are going to return name and this will be the index which is an “Eagle”. At this point, I can do some copy and pasting. I’m going to copy this whole thing because a lot of the rest of this will be else if. So, else if strokes is – this time it’s going to be equal to par-1. And we're going to return “Birdie” which is array index. And I’m going to continue just like this. So, this time it’s if strokes equal par, we're going to return name index. See? Zero. One. Two. Three. It’s going to be the word par up. Keep just like this. Now it’s going to be par+1. And we'll change this to . Now it’s going to be par+2. And we’ll change this to which is going to be the double bogie. And finally, if strokes is – change this to more than or equal to par+3 that means you did very poorly so you should just go home. So, it’s going to be name index. And we don’t need this anymore. So, now we're going to do some tests here. I’m going to do a console.log. And we're going to pass in the function that we're calling. So, in this case, the par is 5 and the strokes are 4. So, that should return “Birdie”. Let’s see what happens. Null. Okay. That’s not what I expected. It’s because this should be names. I spelled this wrong. That’s why it’s sometimes better to check before you go through the whole thing. You can test things as you go. But let’s do that again. Yep \"Birdie”. And if I type in 2 here \"Eagle”. If I type in 8, it’s probably going to tell us to go Home. “Go Home!” Yep. We just completed this challenge. Instead of using chained else if statements you can use a switch statement. A switch statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values. So, let me show you how that works. Here we're going to write a switch statement which tests val and sets the answer to the following conditions. If we pass in 1, the answer should be “alpha”. If we pass in 2, the answer should be “beta”. And so on. So, let me show you how that works. We'll just type in the word switch. That’s the keyword here. And we're testing the val that’s passed into this function. So, it starts off kind of like an if statement. And right now – so, we're going to compare the val to the different cases that we have. So, we'll have case and the first number is going to be 1. So, here we're saying if the case of val is 1, if val = 1 and it’s using the strict equality operator, so it’s like the ===, it’s going to make sure that the type of the variable are the same. So, a string ‘1’ and a number 1 will not be equal. But if the case is 1, then we're going to set answer to = “alpha”. And then we're going to break. Break means that we're at the end of that case statement. And once you break it, it just goes to the end of the switch statement and doesn’t evaluate anything else in the switch statement So, we're also going to have case 2. And one thing I forgot, that we're going to indent that so it’s easier to see the different cases. And case 2, the answer is going to equal to “beta”. And then we also need the break statement. If you don’t have a break statement it will just run through to the next case statement automatically. So, if the case was 1 and you did not have a break here, first it would set the answer to “alpha”. And then it would set the answer to “beta”. It would just skip over to the next case statement. The break is here. It’s going to go out of the switch statement completely. So, it would go – start running the code after this last curly bracket. So, now we're going to do case 3. We’ll just do some copying and pasting here. And we're going to have 4 cases so I’ll just do the rest of the pasting here. So, we’ll have 3 and 4. “alpha” “beta” and then we have “gamma” and “delta”. And we know that the switch statement is over because we have this final curly bracket. And then we're just going to return answer. So, let’s do some tests. To really test this, we're going to have to add a console.log here to log what it’s going to be. And I’ll run this. “Alpha” good. Now 2 should be “beta”. 3 should be “gamma”. Good. And we'll just assume 4 is correct so we're done. Now we'll talk to you about the default option in a switch statement. The default option is kind of like else in an if else statement. So, here’s a switch statement that’s very similar to the one we already saw. And it’s inside this function where we pass in a value into the function. And we're going to check if the value equals a. If it equals a the answer is going to be sent to “apple”. B, answer set to “birds”. C \"cat”. So, in this example we can see that we passed in here – we passed in the a and it returned “apple” because that was one of the options. But what if we pass in something else? If I pass in the number 2 here it’s going to return an empty string. That’s because the answer is set to an empty string and we never override the answer here so it just returns the empty string. What if we want to return something anytime a, b, or c is not passed through. So, for anything else that’s passed into the function, we're going to do default. This is like the else statement. So, the default, we're going to do answer = “stuff”. Again, we're going to have the break. But now, whenever we pass in something that’s not a, b, or c, it’s going to return “stuff”. So, we can pass in 5. It’s going to return “stuff”. But if I go back to passing in c, one of the things we have a case for, it’ll return “cat”. And that’s the switch statement. Sometimes you want a switch statement where multiple inputs give the same output. Well, that’s easy enough by omitting the break statement. Let me show you how that works. So, let’s get a switch statement here. And we're going to have val, that’s what’s passed into the function. And then this case we want the case of 1, 2, and 3 all to return the answer of low. So, I can do it like this, case 1 – and I can go straight into case 2. And then I can go straight into case 3. And since I don’t have any break statement between these cases, it will just keep going to the next one automatically. And now, I’m going to say that the answer is going to be set to equal “Low”. And here is where I put the break statement. Okay, now we're going to do the same thing with cases 4 through 6. And actually, I’m just going to do some copying and pasting. I’m going to copy all this. And now we're going to paste. That’s 4, 5, 6. We're going to do the same thing with 7, 8, 9. So, I’m going to do copy and paste again. And then I’m just going to update the code. So, this is going to be 4, 5, 6. And we'll have 7, 8, 9. And we're going to have “Mid” and “High”. So, if the case is 1, 2, or 3 – like for instance, if it’s 1, it’s going to pass through 2 and 3 to get low. And then it’s going to break about it. If it’s 4, 5, or 6, it’s going to pass through to get to “Mid” and then it’s going to break out 7, 8, and 9. It’s going to pass through to the “High” and break out. So, let’s test this out and see. Since we're passing in the number 1 here it’s going to be “Low”. But if we pass in 5, we should get “Mid.” And if it’s 7, 8, or 9, we should get “High”. Sometimes a switch statement can be easier to write and easier to understand than a chain of if else statements. So, we're going to change this chain of else if statements to become a switch statement. So, let’s do that right now. So, we're going to start with the switch keyword and we're going to be evaluating the value with open curly bracket, and we'll have to make sure to have an end curly bracket at the end. So, for a case “bob” we're going to set the answer to “Marley”. And then we need to have a break in here. For case 42 we're going to set the answer to “The Answer”. For case 1 we’ll set the answer to “There is no 1”. We need a break up here. For case 99 the answer is “Missed me by this much!”. And then we need a break. Now we have for case 7 – 7, 8, 9, and break. And now we just changed that chain of else if statements into a switch statement. Here’s a little trick when you want a function to return a Boolean, a true or false value. You can see in this function, we're checking if a is less than b. And if so, we return true, else we return false. You may remember from before the all comparison operators return a Boolean true or false value. So, instead of using this if statement here we can just – we can actually delete all of this and just return the result of this, return – we’re just returning the result of a is less than b. So, this is going to be true or false. And we can just skip that whole if statement logic and just return this. So, if we console.log this out, console.log, we should be able to see if 10 is less than 15. It is less than 15. It’s true. But if we put a 20 here then it’s false. We've already seen a few examples of this. But you can return early from a function with the return statement. So, if you see this function right here, we return at the very end of the function, so it leaves the function and returns this value from the function. But you can leave the function any time with a return statement. So, we're going to modify this function so that if a or b are less than 0 the function will immediately exit with the value of “undefined”. So, let’s do that. We're going to set an if statement. If a is less than 0, or – that’s two pipes. B is less than 0 then we're going to return undefined. So, we can do a test here, console.log. 8. But what if this is a negative number? It’s going to return undefined. Scrimba has a little quirk here where it just shows null. But in a browser it will show undefined. We are going to create a blackjack card counting function. So, how card counting works, at least how this function is going to work, is that when you see a low card, the count goes up. And when you see a high card, the count goes down. And if it’s a middle value card, the count stays the same. And then when the count is positive, the player should bet high. And when the count is a zero or negative, the player should bet low. So, we are going to use a switch statement to figure out what card has been passed in and what to do about it. You can see that the function looks like this – cc and we pass in card. And depending on what the card is, it’s going to increase this global count variable or it’s going to decrease it, or it’s going to stay the same. And then we are going to return two things. We're not going to return “Change Me”. We're going to return the current count value and whether the player should hold or bet. So, every time you call the cc function it’s going to change this count value and return the total count. So, let’s see how this is going to work. We are going to use the switch statement, like I said. And we're going to check the card value that was passed in. So, if the case is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, we are going to increment the count variable. So, we're going to do it like this – case 2. I’m going to do some copying and pasting. If the case is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, we'll just have to change these values. 3, 4, 5, 6. Now, there are many ways to write any program. This could be done with if statements and else statements. It could be even done with other ways that we haven’t even talked about yet. As long as the program works, in this case, that’s all that matters. So, if you find a different way to write this program, that’s great. So, if the case is 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, we are going to take the count value. And if we just do ++, it increments it by 1. And then we're going to break. Now, if the case is 7, 8, 9 – so let’s paste in three of these. We’ll do 7, 8, 9. Actually, we're going to do nothing. The count is not going to change at all. So, we don’t even need case 7, 8, or 9. So, instead of doing 7, 8, 9, we just need to check in the case that something is actually going to happen. So, we are going to decrement the count variable if we have 10, Jack, Queen, King, or Ace. So, that’s what we're going to change this to. 10 \"Jack”. “Queen”. “King”. or “Ace”. In this case, we're going to decrement the count. So, we're going to do count --. So, that’s the same as count = count -1. And then we will break. Now we've taken care of the count and updating the count, now we have to take care of what we're going to return. We are going to return the count. And we're also going to return whether we are going to hold or bet. So, we're going to actually return a variable. But first there’s going to be a space. There’s a space between the number and then we're going to return the hold variable. Now, this is a variable we haven’t created yet. Normally, this would be the perfect time to use the turn area operator, but we haven’t learn that yet and we're not going to learn that for a few more lessons so I won’t use that now. We are going to set what that hold bet value is. First, we’ll create the holdbet variable. Variable holdbet. And we’ll set it to ‘Hold’. However, if (count) is more than 0, then we can set holdbet to equal ‘Bet’. So, now this should work. Let’s test it out and see if we’ve made any mistakes yet. holtbet is not defined. We have it right here. Oh, we spelled that wrong. So, instead of holtbet that should be holdbet. Okay. In this case, we're going to bet because we had a bunch of positive numbers and then negative numbers. But if we change this to ‘K’ and we change this to 10, let’s see what happens. Now we're going to hold. Okay, it worked. Objects! Objects are similar to arrays except that instead of using indexes to access data, you use properties. So, here’s an object called ourDog. Objects are going to be defined with these curly braces at the beginning and the end. And these are the properties. Now, the properties are everything before the colons. So, we have “name” that’s a property. “legs” is a property. And then the values are the things after the colons here. So, the name is “Camper”. The legs, 4. Tails, there’s only one tail on this dog. And “friends” are “everything”. Now you can see that the properties can be strings. They can be numbers. They can be arrays. They can be any datatype in Javascript. So, now we are going to create our own dog. So, this is going to have a “name”. Personally, I like the name “Quincy”. So, we'll use that for our dog’s name. Also, we're going to have “legs”. Unfortunately, our dog has had an accident. He only has 3 legs. But to make up for only having three legs, he does have 2 tails. And for “friends”, another unfortunate thing, it’s an empty array. He has no friends. Okay. We’ve now created our own object. There are two main ways to access a property on an object. The first I will talk about is dot notation. So, we have this testObj. And we have “hat” “shirt” and “shoes”. And we want to find out the value of these properties. So, right here the hatvalue we're going to set to testObj. Now here’s where we use the dot notation. We just put a dot or a period and then I put the name of the property, .hat. And then for the shirt value, I will do .shirt. So, see this word right here is just a word here. So, the value of hatValue, testObject.hat is now going to be “ballcap”. And the value of the shirtValue is going to be “jersey” Besides using dot notation you can also use bracket notation to access a property in an object. You can use bracket notation anytime but it is required if the name has a space in it. You can see in this object we have three properties. And each of them have a space. So, to get the value of these properties we're going to have to these bracket notation. So, the entreeValue we're going to do testObj. That’s the name of the object. And then we're going to put brackets kind of like an array index. So, you need the opening and closing brackets. And inside we will put the name of the property. So, I’ll do “an entree”. And then we can do it again down here for the drink value. I’ll use a single quote this time instead of a double quote to show that each of those will work. ‘the drink’. And then we need the closing brackets here. So now, entreeValue is set to equal hamburger. And drinkValue is set to equal “water”. Bracket notation can also be used to look up object properties using variables. So, here we have this testObj. We have these different numbers associated with these names here. And we are going to set this variable to be one of the numbers. So, I’ll set this to be 16. So, now we can – in this testObj, 16 is “Montana”. And we can look that up using the variable name instead of the number. So, instead of putting 16, I’m going to put in here. And now player is set to the word, the string \"Montana”. And we use these variable to look up the object property. We can use dot notation to update object properties. Here you can see an object called ourDog. It has a name, legs, tails, friends. And the name is “Camper”. However, here we used dot notation ourDog.name. And use the assignment operator, the equals sign, to set the name to “Happy Camper”. So, if we do console.log on ourDog.name it would no longer be “Camper” it would be “Happy Camper”. Well, we have another dog here with the name of “Coder”. But we want to change the name to “Happy Coder”. So, that’s what I’ll do right here. So, myDog.name = “Happy Coder”. So, just like above, we use dot notation to set the object property to a new value. You can add new properties to an object using dot notation or bracket notation. So, here’s an example right here. We have this object, ourDog. And there’s four properties here. But down here we're adding a new property. ourDog.bark = “bow-wow”. So, it had four properties but now it has 5 properties as the property bark as well. Now down here we'll add a property to the myDog object. So, we can do myDog. And then here I’m going to use bracket notation instead of dot notation. ‘bark’. I’m going to set that to equal “woof”. And because he’s yelling it we’ll have an exclamation point. And that’s how you add properties to objects. It’s simple to delete a property from an object. Our ourDog object has all these properties. And with the delete keyword, delete ourDog.bark. So, now this property here, the bark, has been deleted and is no longer in the object after we’ve deleted it. So, we can do the same thing down here. And this time we will delete the tails property myDog.tails. So, now the myDog object no longer has a tails property. Objects can be thought of as a key value storage like a dictionary. You can use an object too lookup values. So, in this case we have a switch statement that returns certain values. So, when you pass in “alpha” to the function it returns “Adams”. If you pass in “bravo” it returns “Boston”. We can replace this switch statement with an object and use the object for lookups instead of the switch statement. Let me show you how that’s down. I’m going to create var lookup. This is going to be an object here. And the object is going to have a bunch of key value pairs. So, we have alpha and that’s going to be “Adams”. And then we have “bravo”. And the value for “bravo” is going to be “Boston”. And that’s it. So, we can now delete this whole switch statement and now we can say result = lookup. And bracket notation we put the value that was passed in. And then I forgot one thing which was the equals sign here because lookup equals this object. And let’s do a test. So, let me put console.log so we can actually see what happens here. So, if we do “charlie” we're going to get “Chicago”. If we do “foxtrot” the result will be “frank”. So, it works. You can check if an object has a property with the hasown property method. Let me show you how to use this method and finish making this function where we check if an object has a specific property. If it doesn’t have the property we’ll return “Not found”. So, let me show you how that’s going to work. We’ll do myObj – that’s the object up above. .hasOwnProperty. And then we pass in the property we're going to check which is checkProp. This is either going to come back as true or false if it has the property. So, let’s make this into an if statement. if (myObj.hasOwnProperty(checkProp)). But if that’s true, we're going to return myObj and then use bracket notation . So, we're going to return the value of that property. Else we're going to return “Not Found”. So, let’s take off this other return statement. And I’ll do a test. So, when we pass in “gift” here, we returned “pony”. But let’s say we pass in “hello.” Load that \"Not Found”. Okay, it works. A Javascript object is a way to store flexible data. So, you can store strings, numbers, and arrays. And even other objects. So, in this example we have an array called myMusic. We can see it’s an array because we have the open bracket and closed bracket. But inside the array are objects. So, this is one of the objects. And inside the objects are all these key value pairs with the strings and the numbers and so on. So, I’m going to add another object. So, since this is an array, after each element in an array, you have to have a comma. So, I’m going to add a comma here. And then I’m going to add my next record right below this comment here. And we're going to have just like above, we're going to have an “artist”. The artist is going to be “Beau Carnes”. And then we have a “title”. The title will be “Cereal Man”. “release_year” will be “2003”. And for “formats” this is going to be an array, just like above. So, we can have any format. I’m going to put “YouTube video”. And now we've created a second object in our myMusic array. And each object holds data and a property which is the key value format. This is very similar to JSON which we will talk more about later. Here we have an object with other objects nested inside that. So, in order to access sub-properties of an object you can chain together the dot or bracket notation. So, I’m trying to get the gloveBoxContents. So, I’m going to take away this undefined here and I’ll do a myStorage.car.inside. And then now the next thing \"car” “inside” and the last thing is “glove box”. Because there’s a space here we have to use bracket notation. So, I’m going to use bracket notation on the end here and say “glove box”. And now if we run this – see, we're going to console.log. So, let’s see if we get the contents here. Yeah \"maps”. It worked. Array bracket notation can be changed to access nested arrays. You can see we have this array here. And inside this array are two objects. The first element in the array is this object. The second element of the array is this object. And then inside the object we have a key value pair. The key is list and the value is another array here. So, we can combine dot notation and bracket notation to access the second tree. That’s what we're trying to do here. So, let’s do that. First we need to do myPlants. And the trees are the second element in the myPlants array, which is index . Now we need to get the list. So, the list of trees here, so I’m going to do .list. And since .list is an array, I can use the bracket notation to get the second list element which again is array index . So, if we run this it’s going to console.log and we see “pine”. That’s the second tree here. This is a coding challenge we're going to do. We're given this object here which is a record collection. Each record has an ID and then also has different pieces of information about the record. They don’t all have the same information. But see, we have “album” “artist” “tracks” \"album” “artist” “tracks”. This just say “artist” “tracks” and this just has album here. And we are supposed to create this updateRecords function where we can pass in the ID, the property, and the value. And it’s going to update our record collection with the property and the value. So, for instance, if we pass in the ID \"2468” and we put the property “artist”. And if we set a different value, like “Quincy” or something like that, then we should update this whole object. So now it says “Quincy” instead of Prince. And we should return the full collection. So, it’s going to update the collection and then return the collection. If we have an empty string for the value, it should just completely delete that property. Also, if we have the property of tracks and then we have a value, instead of updating the whole tracks here with what we put in, it’s just going to add the track to the end of this array. So, if you look really here, the comment says \"Keep a copy of the collection for tests”. This JSON.parse and JSON.stringify and then collection, this is just a fancy way in Javascript to make a copy of the object. Remember, in our function we are going to be changing the collection object. But we want to have a copy of the original object before anything was changed. So, that’s what that’s for. So, let’s go ahead and do that. So, we're just updating this function here. This update records function. Okay, so let’s get to this. So we'll do if (value)=== blank. Because the first condition we are going to test for is if we need to delete the property. Remember, if the value is set to blank we delete that property. So, if the value is blank, we are going to delete collection. And then we have to use bracket notation and then . The collection, that’s the collection here. If we pass in the ID 1248, it’ll go to there. The property, if we pass in album for the property it would go to here. And then it would just delete that whole thing if our value is an empty string. Okay, the next condition we have to look for is if the property is “tracks”. Because for most properties we're just going to override that property with the value passed into the function. But if the property is tracks, we're going to push onto the end of the array. So, let’s do an else if. Else if (prop) === “tracks”), then we just have to push onto the end of the array. So, there’s also another condition here which is if the tracks property is empty. If the tracks property is empty, we need to create it. Here’s a fancy way to do that. Collection So if prop = tracks, we are going to set the tracks – because remember prop is going to equal tracks. We're going to set the tracks to equal. It’s going to either equal itself if it exists. Or if it doesn’t exist, we're going to create it. I’ll show you how. Collection. It’s going to equal itself. Or – if the or operator is going to equal an empty array. So, if this already exists we're going to set it to equal itself. But if itself doesn’t exist, we'll just set it to equal an empty array. So, that’s just a way to create that property if it doesn’t already exist. So, now that we know it exists we can just push the value to the end of the array. Collection. And we'll just do the .push and then put in the parenthesis, the value. So we're able to push the value that was passed in to the function onto the end of the array. Okay, there’s only one last condition which is the kind of the default condition. Else. So, if the value isn’t blank and the property isn’t tracks, then we just push the value onto the property. Then we just set the property to equal the value, just like this. collection=value. Okay. Let’s test this out. So, we already have this example down here, but to see if it actually worked, we're going to do a console.log so we can see the output there. And if I run that – oh, let me open up the console so we can really see it. So, let’s see what we changed. Go to 5439 and we set the artist which didn’t previously exist to “ABBA”. So, let’s look down here. In the console, 5439 and the artist is “ABBA”. Let’s see what happens when we add a track. So, we'll do one more example here. I’ll just put it right above here, updateRecords. And I’m going to pass in something. I’ll pass in – let’s see, the ID 2468. And we'll pass in the key which is going to be “tracks”. And then for the value, we'll put “test”. So, let’s see what happens here. If we run that, it’s going to update the record here. And then it’s going to update the record again, but we don’t care about that. We mainly care that it’s going to console.log what the final value is. So, if we look at 2468 here. 2468, let’s see the tracks. We got “1999” “Little Red Corvette” and “test”, so it’s working. Great. Loops allow you to run the same code multiple times. I’m going to talk to you about a while loop that runs while a specified condition is true and stops once it’s no longer true. So, we are going to push the digit 0 through 4 onto this array. Here’s how it’s going to work. while is the while loop. while i is less than 5. And we're going to do something while that’s true. First, we have to set what i starts off at. So, var i = 0. So, while i is less than 5, we'll do myArray.push(i). Just push it onto the array. And to make sure this loop eventually ends, I’ll have to do i++ which increments i. So, then I will test this out by doing console.log. And I’m going to console.log the myArray. So, let’s see if this works. I’ll run this and check the console. . The while loop worked. Every time it went through this five different times and pushed 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 onto the loop. A for loop is the most common type of loop in Javascript. So here is an example of a for loop. You start with the keyword for. And then we have these parentheses with three different items and they’re separated by semicolons. The first thing is the initialization. Then we have the condition. Then we have the final expression. So, the initialization happens before any of the code inside the loop runs. So, we will start by initializing i to equal 0. So, this is what most for loops start with, is you have a variable that you’re going to initialize for the for loop. Then the next thing is the condition. So, once this evaluates to false we break out of the loop. So, while i is less than 5 we'll continue to run through the loop over and over until this is false and we break out of the loop. The final thing is what we do at the end of each iteration. At the end of each iteration, we will increment i by 1. In this example, we are filling our array with the numbers 0 through 4. I’m going to do another example where we fill an array with the numbers 1 through 5. So, we'll start with 4. Now, we're going to initialize i to equal 1. We're starting with 1 instead of 0 this time. And we're going to do i is less than 6. So while i is less than 6 or until i is more than 6, we are going to run all the code in this loop. And at the end of each iteration, we are going to increment i. Now I can just do what we have before. myArray.push(i). So, the final thing we will do is test this. I will do console.log and put myArray inside here. And I’ll just load this and see what we see in the console. . It worked. We iterated five different times and each time we pushed a new digit onto the array. And at the end of each iteration we incremented i so it pushed a larger number onto the array. Loops don’t just have to increment one at a time. Look at this for loop here. We have our initialization where we initialize i to 0. And then we are going to run the loop until i is less than 10. And finally, our increment, instead of incrementing i by 1, we're incrementing i by 2. So, now this is going to push all the even numbers onto the array. We have console.log, so let’s log it out and see what it looks like. . I’m going to write another loop right now that creates an array of odd numbers. So, let’s do that. for (var) i = 1. We’ll start at 1. While i is less than 10. I can use 10 again. I’m going to do i +=2. So, we're still going to count by 2s, but since we're starting at 1 instead of 0 this should give us the odd numbers. So, let’s see what’s going to be inside our loop. myArray.push and I’ll just put i there. So, let’s log this out and see if we did it right. console.log(myarray). And I’ll run that. . It worked. A for loop can also be used to count backwards. So, if we see this for loop here, we’re initializing i to 10. We're starting at 10 and we're going back to 0. So, we're going to iterate through this loop while i is more than 0. We’re going to keep iterating. And at the end of each iteration we're going to decrement i instead of increment it. We're going to go down by 2. i -= 2 means i=i-2. So, we're going to continue pushing the lower and lower numbers onto the array until i is less than 0. So, let’s log this out and see what ourArray becomes. You can see . Well, I’m going to write another where we’re going to push the odd numbers from 9 through 1 to myArray. So, another for loop. And I’m going to do var i = 9 because we want to start at 9. Now we’ll still do i is more than 0. So while i is more than 0 we're going to keep going through this array. And we'll do i – and everything else is really the same. -= 2. And this is going to get all the odd numbers onto the array. So, we just have to do myArray.push and then push on the i there. Now we'll just console.log so we can see what it ended up as. myArray. And I’ll run the code. We did it. It is common in Javascript to iterate through the contents of an array. So, look at this example. We have this array here. Before, we were always adding items to the array. But this time the array already exists. Right here, ourArr = . So, we are going to start at 0. But now instead of going to a specific number of iterations, we are going to the OurArr.length. So, the length is 4 here. But if we added elements to this array, that means this loop would just go even longer until we went through every element of that array. And then at the end we're going to increment i by one at the end of each iteration. So, look at what we're doing inside the array. We're going doing ourTotal that starts off at 0 up here. And we’re doing +=. That means we're going to do ourTotal = ourTotal plus something else. So, we're going to keep adding to the total whatever is in the array at that index. So, ourArr. So, it starts at 0. And then it goes 1, 2, 3 until it gets to 4 which is the length of the array and it doesn’t even run the iteration at 4. And there is no index on the array. Remember, it’s 0, 1, 2, 3. So this is just going to add up all those numbers. If we run this we can see it adds up to 42. I’m going to write another for loop down here that’s going to add up all the numbers in this array here. So, we'll do for (var i = 0). And then we’ll do i is less than myArr.length. And i++. So, just like before. For each element in myArr we're going to do a total += myArr index . So, we have to initialize the total variable right up here. So, we'll do a var total = 0. And then at the end we’ll just console.log that out to see what the total is. So, if I just run this we can see that the total this time is 20. If you have a multidimensional or nested array, you can use nested for loops to access all the array elements. So, for instance, we have this multiple all function. It’s defined up here, but we're calling it here and we're passing in this multidimensional array. Which is basically an array with the arrays inside the array. So, inside the first array there are three elements. One. Two. Three. And you can see each of those elements are in array with their own set of elements. So, we are going to use nested for loops within this multiply all function to multiply every number in these nested arrays here. So, let’s get started. We're going to start with a for loop. And it’s going to look just like the other for loops that we started. i = 0. We’re going to initialize i to 0. And then we're going to say while i is less than arr.length. And then we're just going to increment i at the end of each iteration. Now, arr.length, that’s going to start off as 3 because we're passing in this array. And the first level of the array, there’s just one, two, three elements. So, that’s going to be 3. But now, we're going to go inside this for loop and create another for loop. So, we're going to do var j = 0. Normally, it’s standard practice to call the variable that we're incrementing i, but we already have an i within this scope. So, we need to create another name and it’s pretty standard to call the next variable j because j is after i. So, now we're going to do a j. while j is less than – now this is where it gets a little tricky. We're going to do while a is less than arr index.length. Also, we're going to increment j here. So, this is going to change. So, the first iteration of this outer for loop, we're looking at the length of this array. Then we're looking at the length of this array. Then we're looking at the length of this array. The index is going to be different every time so we're going to be going to each different array inside the nested array. So, at this point, we just have to multiply all the numbers together. So, we already have the product that we've defined above. So, we're going to do product *= which is just going to multiply everything to"
